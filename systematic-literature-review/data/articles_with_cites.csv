The system design phase contains the transformation of all-natural language requirements into models. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) use case model is regarded as one of the most helpful diagrams for a software developer to understand the higher version of the software blueprint. It’s very useful to reflects the business requirements for any proposed software system. Manual analysis requires significant time and effort, highlighting the need for automated assistance. This study aims to enhance the machine learning techniques that have been utilized to transform user stories and functional requirements into a UML use case diagram. This research also investigate the use of an automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool and framework for mapping use case diagram elements from user stories and functional requirements written in natural languages. The proposed approach using a NLP based machine learning framework called BERT to predict and extract actors, use cases, and the relationship between actors and use cases. This approach has been applicable for both user stories and functional requirements. A dataset has been pre-processed in order to train this model and collected from various sources like Kaggle, software projects. There are 11 user stories and 11 functional requirements were selected to test the proposed solution. The data set from benchmark repositories. The extracted results during the whole NLP process are then mapped into actors, use cases, and relationships. This study was evaluated using both accuracy and precision values for performance measures. By applying NLP technologies, this research offers complete support for extracting elements and generating a use case diagram and revealed the 88% accuracy and 88% precision.",2024-05-31,,,,,,0

This paper presents an automated approach for generating behavioral models specifically sequence diagrams from natural language requirements expressed as user stories. We also investigate the effectiveness of a Large Language Model (LLM) in using generative AI for this task. By applying our approach and ChatGPT to two benchmark datasets with the same set of user stories, we generated corresponding sequence diagrams for comparison.

Software developers then analyze these requirements to create domain models represented in UML diagrams in an attempt to comprehend what users need in the software products. These domain models are usually converted into design models and finally carried over into classes in source code. Thus, domain models have an impact on the final software products. However, creating correct domain models can be difficult when software developers are not skilled. Moreover, even for skilled developers, when requirements are large, wading through all requirements to create domain models can take times and might result in errors. Therefore, researchers have studied various approaches to apply natural language processing techniques to transform requirements written in natural language into UML diagrams. Those researches focus on requirements written in English. This paper proposes an approach to process requirements written in Thai to extract UML class diagrams using natural language processing techniques. The UML class diagram extraction is based on transformation rules that identify classes and attributes from requirements. The results are evaluated with recall and precision using truth values created by humans. Future works include identifying operations and relationships from requirements to complete class diagram extraction.

Many methodologies have been proposed, but the majority of them are focused on the waterfall approach, making adopting privacy engineering in agile software development difficult. The other major issue is that the process currently is to a high degree manual. This paper focuses on closing these gaps through the development of a machine learning-based approach for identifying privacy requirements in an agile software development environment, employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our method aims to allow agile teams to focus on functional requirements while NLP tools assist them in generating privacy requirements. The main input for our method is a collection of user stories, which are typically used to identify functional requirements in agile software development. The NLP approach is then used to automate some human-intensive tasks such as identifying personal data and creating data flow diagrams from user stories. The data flow diagram forms the basis for the automatic creation of privacy requirements. Our evaluation shows that our NLP method achieves a fairly good performance in terms of F-Measure. We are also demonstrate the feasibility of our NLP approach in CamperPlus project. Lastly, we are developing a tool to integrate our NLP approach into the privacy requirements engineering pipeline, allowing for manual editing of results so that agile teams can maintain control over the automated approach.",2024,,,,,,5

In agile software development, the user story is a simple description of the functionality of the software. It is presented from the user's point of view and is written in natural language. Acceptance criteria are a list of specifications on how a new software feature is expected to operate. Our approach analyzes a set of acceptance criteria accompanying the user story, in order, first, to automatically generate the components of the business model, and then to produce the business model as an activity diagram which is a unified modeling language (UML) behavioral diagram. We start with the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract the elements necessary to define the rules for retrieving artifacts from the business model. These rules are then developed in Prolog language and imported into Python code. The proposed approach was evaluated on a set of use cases using different performance measures. The results indicate that our method is capable of generating correct and accurate process models.",2023-02-01,,,,,,13

However, these tools suffer from difficulties due to the inherent imprecision and ambiguity commonly found in natural language expressions. In this article, we present an overview and a study of approaches and tools designed to extract UML diagrams from textual requirements using NLP and computational linguistics techniques. Furthermore, we introduce approaches employing deep learning techniques. Next, we provide a descriptive study and comparative analysis of the limitations and contributions of these automatic and semiautomatic tools, as well as solutions for improving the existing state of the art.",2024,,,,,,3
